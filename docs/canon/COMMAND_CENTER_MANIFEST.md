# COMMAND CENTER MANIFEST (D61.0)

> **Authority:** ANTIGRAVITY
> **Date:** 2026-02-06
> **Status:** CANON

## 1. Identity
The Command Center is **NOT** a dashboard. It is a **Real-Time Institutional Attention Allocator**.
It does not passively display data; it actively filters noise to show *where context is strongest today*. It is a biological HUD for the Founder/Elite user, designed to induce instant coherence between market reality and internal models.

## 2. Value Delivered
- **Speed to Coherence:** Reduces time-to-decision from minutes to seconds.
- **Truth Integrity:** Every pixel is backed by a verified artifact or active probe.
- **Visual Priming:** Uses color, blur, and density to prime the user's brain for specific regimes (e.g., High Volatility vs. Stale Drift).
- **Unfair Advantage:** Exposes signals (Coherence Quartet) that are invisible to retail tools.

## 3. Allowed Output Types
1.  **Status Signal:** (Green/Yellow/Red/Cyan) -> System Health.
2.  **Context Density:** (Blur/Sharpness) -> How much do we know?
3.  **Directional Confidence:** (Glow/Breathing) -> Strong signal presence.
4.  **Operational State:** (Locked/Open) -> Safe to act?

**STRICTLY PROHIBITED:**
- "Buy/Sell" Directives.
- Price Targets.
- Predictive "Crystal Ball" language.
- Unverified/Hallucinated data.

## 4. Tooltip Explanation Contract
Every visual element must explain itself upon interaction (Tap/Hover).
- **The "Why":** Why is this glowing? (e.g., "3 Sigma Volatility + Options Skew").
- **The Source:** Where did this come from? (e.g., "Macro Artifact D56.1").
- **The Risk:** What invalidates this? (e.g., "Stale Data > 5 mins").

## 5. Data Source Rules
1.  **Artifact-First:** Prefer reading from `outputs/proofs/` or `brain/` over raw API calls where possible.
2.  **Compute-to-Cache:** Heavy logic runs in background; Command Center reads the cached snapshot.
3.  **Fail-Hidden:** Missing data disappears; it does not show "Error" unless critical (Red).

## 6. Visual Language Rules
- **Non-Directive:** Show the *state*, not the *command*.
- **Descriptive:** "Volatility is High" (Allowed) vs "Close Positions" (Prohibited).
- **Priming:** Use `AppColors.neonCyan` for "Unfair Advantage/Elite" signals.
