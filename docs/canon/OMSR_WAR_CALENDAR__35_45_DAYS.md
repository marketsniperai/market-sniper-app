# OMSR WAR CALENDAR — 35-45 DAYS TO VICTORY

**Authority:** STRATEGIC (Canonical)
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** CANONICAL

## 🛡️ Governance Rule — OMSR Campaign Ledger

Any Day marked as SEALED (PASS) in this calendar must:
1.  Produce a `SEAL_DAY_XX_*.md` artifact.
2.  Update this document immediately, marking the day as `[x]`.
3.  **NEVER** be unchecked, rewritten, or re-interpreted backward.

This rule is **binding** for all future Antigravity prompts. The Campaign moves forward only.
