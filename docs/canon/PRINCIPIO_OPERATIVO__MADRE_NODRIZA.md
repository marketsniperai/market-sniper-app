# PRINCIPIO OPERATIVO: MADRE NODRIZA (G0.CANON_0)

**Authority:** SUPREME
**Sync Date:** Day 31 (The Surgeon)

## 1. The Founder Law
The Founder is the supreme authority. Any automated block, gate, or hiding mechanism MUST have a bypass for the Founder (`X-Founder-Key`).

## 2. The Law of Truth
Truth exists ONLY in Artifacts (`.json`). The API is merely a "Lens" (View) on top of artifacts.
- API does not calculate. It reads.
- API does not persist state in RAM. It writes to Artifacts.

## 3. The Law of Silence & Autonomy
The System operates according to the **Autonomy Dial**.
- **SHADOW (Default):** The System thinks and suggests, but DOES NOT act without invitation.
- **SAFE_AUTOPILOT:** The System may act autonomously ONLY in the **GREEN** Stability Band, with sufficient evidence.
- **THE SURGEON:** The System may self-repair runtime artifacts ONLY if risk is **LOW** and action is **REVERSIBLE**.

## 4. The Titanium Law (Day 28)
**"AGMS Thinks. Autofix Acts. Policy Decides."**
- **Architecture:** Separation of concerns is absolute. Intelligence modules (AGMS) cannot execute. Ops modules (Autofix) cannot think. They are bridged by signed Handoff Tokens.
- **Gating:** The Autopilot Policy Engine is the final arbiter. It rejects actions if the Band is unstable or Risk is high.

## 5. The Law of Reform (Day 31)
**"Source is Sacred. Runtime is Regenerable."**
- **Source Code:** The AI is strictly FORBIDDEN from modifying source code files autonomously. It may only PROPOSE source patches.
- **Runtime State:** The AI is AUTHORIZED to autonomously repair/regenerate runtime artifacts (`outputs/`) if they drift or break, provided it creates a backup first (The Surgeon).

## 6. The Misfire Protocol
If the Pipeline fails (Misfire):
- The System admits the failure (Misfire Monitor Report).
- The System suggests action (Autoheal Playbook).
- **If SAFE_AUTOPILOT:** The System executes recovery automatically.
- **If SHADOW/OFF:** The System waits for the Founder.
