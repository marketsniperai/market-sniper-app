# GLOSSARY (G0.CANON_1)

**Authority:** SEMANTIC TRUTH

## Definitions

### Artifact
A static JSON file generated by a pipeline or engine. It is the atomic unit of truth in the system.

### ARTIFACTS_ROOT
The immutable single-source directory (`backend/outputs/`) where all valid system artifacts must reside.

### Lens
The status of the API Server. It does not calculate or think; it only reads, validates, and serves artifacts.

### Gate
A logic check (e.g., Stale Check, Entitlement) applied by the Lens to an artifact before serving it.

### Critical Gates
Gates that must pass for the system to be considered "LIVE" (e.g., Data Freshness, Circuit Breaker).

### Fallback
A safe, partial response returned by the Lens when an artifact is missing or invalid, ensuring no crashes (500s).

### CALIBRATING
System status indicating that required artifacts are generating or not yet available.

### MISSING_ARTIFACT
A specific error reason code indicating a required JSON file is absent from the ARTIFACTS_ROOT.

### SCHEMA_INVALID
A reason code indicating an artifact exists but failed Pydantic validation.

### Founder Mode
A high-privilege system override, triggered by keys/headers, allowing forensic access and bypassing standard filtering.

### LKG (Last Known Good)
The most recent validated state or artifact that the system can revert to in case of failure.

### Truth Surface
The minimal set of endpoints and artifacts required to prove the system is operational and honest.

### Seal
A cryptographic-like governance event (Markdown file) marking the completion and verification of a critical step.

### Contract
An immutable document defining the boundaries, behaviors, and obligations of system components.

### Evidence Index
A manifest listing all proofs (logs, screenshots, curls) required to validify a Seal.
