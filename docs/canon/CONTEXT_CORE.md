CONTEXT CORE — MarketSniper AI

Last Updated: 2026-01-28 (Day 47 HF34)
Status: SEALED / CANONICAL
Owner: Founder (Sergio)
Primary Objective: Massive revenue fast, without sacrificing legality, honesty, or long-term scalability.

1) IDENTITY & PRIME DIRECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

MarketSniper AI is an institutional-grade market context operating system.

It delivers:

Descriptive market intelligence

Daily context snapshots (Iron OS)

Regime framing and risk classification

Evidence-based historical memory

News and macro interpretation surfaces

Ritualized usage loops (Premarket, Aftermarket, Weekly)

The system is designed to describe reality with structural honesty, preserve coherence over time, and degrade safely when information is insufficient.

Legal safety and trust are not communicated — they are architected.

2) BUSINESS OBJECTIVE (INTERNAL)

Primary Goal

Generate massive revenue as fast as possible while preserving:

Legal safety

Intellectual honesty

Long-term scalability

Institutional credibility

Secondary Goals (valid only if the primary goal remains intact):

Cognitive clarity

Reduction of user decision errors

High daily retention through ritualized context

Paid conversion driven by observable value

Pricing Posture

$150/month must feel negligible relative to value delivered.

Trust, recurrence, and clarity are the core retention drivers.

3) SYSTEM POSITIONING (POSITIVE DEFINITION)

MarketSniper AI operates as:

A market context engine

A regime and risk classification system

A descriptive intelligence layer

A memory-driven historical comparison engine

A daily decision-support ritual

Its differentiation comes from architecture, not claims.

4) CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Architecture-first

Context over ideas

Evidence over narratives

Institutional tone

N/A over guessing

Fail-safe over convenience

Trust over features

Ritual over random usage

If truth cannot be guaranteed, the system degrades gracefully.

5) SYSTEM MENTAL MODEL (HOW IT OPERATES)

MarketSniper AI frames environments and conditions.

It continuously answers:

What regime is active?

What risks dominate?

What dispersion exists?

What historical evidence is relevant?

What information is missing or unreliable?

What is the current confidence level?

What behavioral posture is appropriate?

This model is descriptive, not directive.

6) OPERATING SYSTEM LAYERS (SEALED)

Layer 1 — SNAPSHOT
Daily artifact-first market snapshot (Single Source of Truth).

Layer 2 — PULSE
Intraday context, drift and anomaly monitoring.

Layer 3 — PROJECTION (SYNTHESIS)
Central mixer of Snapshot + Pulse + News. Probabilistic context vs directional prediction.

Layer 4 — REAL-TIME EVENTS
News and macro surfaces translated into context.

Layer 5 — IRON (THE MIRROR)
State history, replay, and forensic integrity.

Layer 6 — META WATCHDOG
System health, provider integrity, drift enforcement, SAFE MODE.

7) PHASE STRUCTURE (SEALED)
Phase B — Foundation & Safety ✅ CLOSED

Autonomous pipeline, locks, integrity, universe, governance.

Phase C — Intelligence Layer ✅ SEALED

Context, options intelligence, evidence engine, effectiveness, monetization (shadow).

Phase D — Elite Ritual Engine ✅ DONE

Premarket, Aftermarket, Weekly rituals and Elite conversion loop.

Phase 5 — Feature Phase v1 ✅ COMPLETED

Dashboard, War Room, Iron OS, Elite UX, Watchlist, Shell & Premium.

Phase 6 — Institutional Polish (Day 46) ✅ COMPLETED

Phase 11 — Projection & News (Day 47) ✅ COMPLETED

Central Brain (Projection Orchestrator), News Engine, On-Demand Area (FROZEN/SEALED).

Phase 12 — Transcendence (Future)

Scale, multi-asset expansion, institutional B2B.

8) SEALED GOVERNANCE — DOCTRINA OFICIAL

Canonical hierarchy:

PRINCIPIO OPERATIVO — MADRE NODRIZA

CONTEXT CORE (this document)

MAP CORE

SYSTEM ATLAS

IDEAS VAULT (non-canonical)

All claims must be production-observable and verifiable.

9) MAJOR SYSTEM PATCHES (HISTORICAL)

Critical fixes and recovery sprints retained for audit lineage.

10) RELATIONSHIP PROTOCOL (AI ASSISTANT)

The assistant operates as:

Long-term strategic co-architect

Guardian of clarity and legality

Architecture-first systems thinker

Proactive value officer

Communication policy:

Code, docs, artifacts: English

Founder communication: Spanish (direct, collaborative)

11) CURRENT PRIORITY (JAN 2026)

Governance alignment complete

Kernel Risk Lanes (D46)

Polish and experiential refinement

North Star:
MarketSniper must feel indispensable.

12) HOW TO RESUME WORK IN ANY NEW CHAT

Assume:

Architecture is correct

Safety is embedded

Ritual system is active

Revenue is the north star

Proceed directly to the next highest-leverage improvement.
