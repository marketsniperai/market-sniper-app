# SYSTEM CONTRACT (G0.CANON_1)

**Version:** 1.0 (Genesis)
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Authority:** ANTIGRAVITY

## 1. System Identity
**MarketSniper OS** is a **Descriptive Intelligence Engine**. It processes raw market data into structured JSON artifacts. It does NOT predict the future; it describes the present with extreme fidelity ("Night Finance" doctrine).

## 2. The Contract of Truth
The System Contract defines the immutable boundary between the **Engine** (Backend) and the **Experience** (App/Client).

### 2.1 The "Lens" Doctrine
- The API is a **Reading Lens** over static artifacts.
- The API does **not** think. The Pipeline thinks.
- The UI does **not** calculate. It renders.

### 2.2 The "One Truth" Rule
- There is exactly **ONE** Artifacts Root (`backend/outputs/`).
- All endpoints must serve data derived from this root.
- Side-channels (direct DB access, temp files) are **BANNED**.

## 3. Governance
This contract is the **Supreme Law** of the repository. Changes to this contract require a **G-Level Seal** (Governance Event).
