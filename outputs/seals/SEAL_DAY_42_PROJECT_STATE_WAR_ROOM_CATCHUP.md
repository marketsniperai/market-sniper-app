## 1. Summary
Performed a deterministic "War Room Catch-Up" on `PROJECT_STATE.md`. Enumerated all canonical seals for Day 41 (Iron OS) and Day 42 (Self-Heal Arc) and cross-referenced with `OMSR_WAR_CALENDAR__35_45_DAYS.md`. Appended a patch block reflecting the exact sealed state.

## 2. Data Sources
- **Seals**: `outputs/seals/*.md` (Enumerated 21 relevant seals).
- **War Calendar**: `docs/canon/OMSR_WAR_CALENDAR__35_45_DAYS.md` (Verified [x] marks).

## 3. Updates
**Appended to PROJECT_STATE.md:**
- **[PARTIAL] DAY 41 — IRON OS VISIBILITY**: Documented sealed items (Status, Timeline, History, Drift, LKG, Decision, Integrity) and noted pending items (Replay/Rollback UI).
- **[SEALED] DAY 42 — SELF-HEAL ARC COMPLETE**: Documented all sealed items (Lock, Coverage, Housekeeper, AutoFix T1, Misfire T2, Red Button, Cooldown, Findings, Diff, Decision, Root Cause, Confidence, Change Log).

## 4. Verification
- **Proof**: `outputs/proofs/day_42/day_42_project_state_war_room_catchup_proof.json`
- **Git Check**: Verified `PROJECT_STATE.md` is modified and clean otherwise.

**PROJECT STATE SYNCHRONIZED.**
