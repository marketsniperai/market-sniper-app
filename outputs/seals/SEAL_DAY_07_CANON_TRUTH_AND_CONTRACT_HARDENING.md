## STATUS: PASS
The system is contract-compliant and drift-aware under OMSR doctrine. The Canonical Artifact Contract has been normalized for Cloud Run runtime paths, and verifying agents confirm strict adherence to System Laws.

## VERIFICATION
- [x] **Artifact Contract**: PASSED. `run_manifest.json` and `dashboard_market_sniper.json` exist, valid JSON, `schema_version` present, no `.tmp` files.
- [x] **Endpoint Contract**: PASSED. All core endpoints return 200 pass/fail status blocks, no 500s.
- [x] **System Laws**: PASSED. Audit confirms Law of Lens (read-only), Truth (no guessing), and Silence (logging).
- [x] **Canon Update**: `ARTIFACT_CONTRACT.md` updated with Runtime Paths.

## EVIDENCE
- **Artifact Scan**: `outputs/runtime/day_07_artifact_contract_scan.json`
- **Endpoint Scan**: `outputs/runtime/day_07_endpoint_contract_scan.json`
- **Laws Audit**: `outputs/runtime/day_07_system_laws_audit.md`
- **Drift Policy**: `outputs/runtime/day_07_drift_policy.txt`

## SYSTEM STATE
The system is now a **Trusted Source of Truth**. Logic is locked, artifacts are verified, and the interface is hardened against ambiguity.
