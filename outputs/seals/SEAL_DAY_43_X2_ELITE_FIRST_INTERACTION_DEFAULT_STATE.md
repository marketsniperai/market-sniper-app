# SEAL: DAY 43.X2 — ELITE FIRST INTERACTION (DEFAULT STATE)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This seal guarantees that the Elite Context Engine always greets the user first when opened via the main icon.

## 1. Scope
- **Entry Logic**: `resetToWelcome` flag added to `EliteInteractionSheet`.
- **Top Icon**: Forces `resetToWelcome: true` -> Shows Greeting + Questions.
- **Explain Actions**: Preserves `resetToWelcome: false` -> Shows Explained Context.
- **Home Button**: Added "ELITE HOME" to allow returning to Greeting from Explain View.

## 2. Verification
- **Test:** Open via Icon -> Greeting Visible.
- **Test:** Open via Explain -> Context Visible.
- **Test:** Tap Home -> Returns to Greeting.
- **Proof:** [First Interaction Proof](file:///c:/MSR/MarketSniperRepo/outputs/proofs/day_43/day_43_x2_elite_first_interaction_default_state_proof.json)

## 3. Governance
- **Status:** SEALED
- **Type:** UX_HOLDER
- **Authorized By:** Founder (via Antigravity)
