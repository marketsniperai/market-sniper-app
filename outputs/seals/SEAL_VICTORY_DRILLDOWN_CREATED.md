# SEAL: VICTORY CHECKLIST DRILLDOWN CREATED
**Date:** 2026-01-13
**Author:** Antigravity
**Goal:** Create a granular, verifiable roadmap companion to the Clean Victory Checklist.

## Actions
1. **Created:** `docs/canon/B_VICTORY_CHECKLIST__DRILLDOWN.md`
   - Based on `legacy/B_VICTORY_CHECKLIST__RAW.md` and `B_VICTORY_CHECKLIST__CLEAN.md`.
   - Links to existing seals (Day 00-05) for Phase B.
   - Marks later phases as [UNVERIFIED] pending legacy seal migration.
2. **Updated:** `docs/canon/CANON_INDEX.md`
   - Added `target_state_drilldown` reference.

## Evidence
- `outputs/runtime/drilldown_diff_proof.txt`
- `outputs/runtime/drilldown_snapshot.txt`

## Verification
- **Drilldown Structure:** Phase B fully linked to sealed artifacts.
- **Canon Index:** Correctly references the new drilldown file.

## Missing Evidence Logic
The drilldown correctly identifies that artifacts from "Elite Arc", "Iron OS Arc", and "Beast Release" are currently [UNVERIFIED] in this repository scope, requiring future migration or reimplementation seals. This provides a clear roadmap for "Day 06" and beyond.
