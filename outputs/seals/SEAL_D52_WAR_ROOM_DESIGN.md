# SEAL: D52 WAR ROOM DESIGN EXPLORATION

**ID:** SEAL_D52_WAR_ROOM_DESIGN
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Objectives:** Define UX principles, IA, and visual hierarchy for War Room V2.
**Status:** SEALED
**Decision:** Variant A ("Founder Dense") Adopted.

## Execution Summary
We successfully conducted a design exploration to transform the War Room into an "Institutional Command Center".

### Key Principles Established
1.  **Silent Cockpit:** System is visually quiet unless there are anomalies.
2.  **Density is Safety:** Critical metrics must fit above the fold.
3.  **Traffic Light Protocol:** Restricted color usage (Green=Dim, Red=Bright).
4.  **No Dead Ends:** All widgets link to source data.

### Selected Architecture: Variant A ("Founder Dense")
The "Founder Dense" layout was selected to prioritize simultaneous visibility of Infrastructure and Intelligence.
-   **Zone 1:** Global Command Bar (Fixed Top)
-   **Zone 2:** Service Honeycomb (Infrastructure)
-   **Zone 3:** Alpha Strip (Intelligence)
-   **Zone 4:** Console/Gates (Context & Action)

### Artifacts Scoped
-   **Design Definition:** `design/WAR_ROOM_UX_EXPLORATION.md`

## Next Steps
-   Begin Phase 11: Implementation of War Room V2 (Variant A).
-   Refactor existing tiles into the "Honeycomb" and "Ticker" patterns.
