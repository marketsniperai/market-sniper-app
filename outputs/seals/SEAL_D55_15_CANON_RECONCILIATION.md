# SEAL_D55_15_CANON_RECONCILIATION

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Operation:** Canon Reconciliation (Day 41-55)
**Status:** SEALED
**Authority:** ANTIGRAVITY CONSTITUTIONAL OVERRIDE

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The System Canon has been fully reconciled with the Sealed Historical Reality from Day 41 to Day 55.
The "Lost Era" of documentation (Days 41-55) is now officially recorded in `OMSR_WAR_CALENDAR`, `PROJECT_STATE`, and core Canon files.
The project status is advanced to **PHASE 8: INFRASTRUCTURE RESTORATION (DAY 55)**.

## 2. Actions Taken

### A. Timeline Reconstruction
- Rebuilt `OMSR_WAR_CALENDAR__35_55_DAYS.md` (Renamed from `35_45`).
- Appended missing chronological logs for Days 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55.
- Documented D55.0 through D55.14 seals explicitly.

### B. Project State Synchronization
- Updated `PROJECT_STATE.md` Header to **PHASE 8**.
- Cleaned corrupted tail logs.
- Appended the "Restoration Arc" (D53-D55) logs, confirming the full recovery of Cloud Run, Hosting, and Public/Private gates.

### C. System Atlas & Modules (Infrastructure)
- Updated `SYSTEM_ATLAS.md`:
    - Added **Section 16: Infrastructure & Deployment (Day 55)**.
    - Documented Cloud Run, Load Balancer, Firebase Hosting, and Rewrite Architecture.
- Updated `OS_MODULES.md`:
    - Added `OS.Infra.CloudRun`, `OS.Infra.LB`, `OS.Infra.Hosting`.

### D. Debt Reconciliation
- Updated `PENDING_LEDGER.md`:
    - Resolved `PEND_INFRA_API_GATEWAY_DEPLOY` (Superseded by LB+NEG).
    - Resolved `PEND_AUTH_FIREBASE_FULL` (Superseded by IAM Policy/Hosting).

## 3. Verified State
- **Canon Reality**: Matches Sealed Reality.
- **Drift**: NEGLIGIBLE.
- **Warroom**: `OMSR_WAR_CALENDAR__35_55_DAYS.md` is now the active tactical map.

## 4. Next Steps
- **Execution**: Proceed to Day 56 (if planned) or D55.16 (Post-Restoration Tuning).
- **Maintenance**: Treat `PROJECT_STATE.md` as append-only law.
