# SEAL: OMSR WAR CALENDAR CANONIZATION

## 1. Action
The document `docs/canon/OMSR_WAR_CALENDAR__35_45_DAYS.md` has been created and canonized.

## 2. Declaration
"OMSR War Calendar has been canonized as a live, seal-driven checklist.
It is now the authoritative record of campaign progress."

## 3. Governance Rule Enacted
*   **Binding Checkmarks**: A day receives a `[x]` ONLY upon the creation of a corresponding `SEAL_DAY_XX`.
*   **Immutable Past**: Once checked, a day cannot be unchecked.
*   **Live Ledger**: This document MUST be updated with every future seal.

## 4. Initial State
*   **Sealed Days**: D00 to D08 (Verified against `outputs/seals/`).
*   **Pending Days**: D09 to D45.

## 5. Verification
*   All links in the Calendar point to existing, valid SEAL artifacts.
*   Phases align with the Strategic Master Plan.
