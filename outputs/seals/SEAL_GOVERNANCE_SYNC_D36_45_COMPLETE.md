**Type:** GOVERNANCE / CHECKPOINT
**Date:** 2026-01-23
**Authority:** ANTIGRAVITY
**Status:** SEALED

## 1. Governance Audit
A full system audit was performed to reconcile the "War Room Reality" (Code/Runtime) with the "Canonical Truth" (Docs).

### Findings
*   **War Room**: Fully active. All D36-D45 engines (Options, Macro, Evidence, Iron, Elite, Self-Heal) are wired and operational.
*   **Module Inventory**: `OS_MODULES.md` was stale (missing Iron OS, Replay, Voice Stub, etc.).
*   **Canon Docs**: `PRINCIPIO_OPERATIVO`, `SYSTEM_ATLAS`, and `CONTEXT_CORE` required structural updates to reflect the "Feature Phase" completion.

## 2. Actions Taken
1.  **Repaired `docs/canon/OS_MODULES.md`**:
    *   Rebuilt inventory table to Version 3.0.
    *   Added 14+ missing modules (Iron, Elite, Watchlist, etc.).
    *   Verified endpoint mappings.
    *   Aligned with `backend/api_server.py`.

2.  **Synced `docs/canon/PRINCIPIO_OPERATIVO__MADRE_NODRIZA.md`**:
    *   Updated to Version 45 (Feature Phase).
    *   Added "Layer D — IRON (THE MIRROR)".
    *   Updated "Tone Policy" (100% English Artifacts).

3.  **Synced `docs/canon/SYSTEM_ATLAS.md`**:
    *   Updated to Version 45.
    *   Added Iron OS Arc, Real-Time Arc, Elite Arc, Watchlist Arc.
    *   Marked all as COMPLETED.

4.  **Synced `docs/canon/CONTEXT_CORE.md`**:
    *   Updated to Jan 2026 (Day 45).
    *   Aligned Phase Structure with War Calendar.

## 3. Verification
*   **Code Integrity**: NO code logic changes were made.
*   **Canon Consistency**: All 4 core docs now cite "Day 45" or "Feature Phase".
*   **Git Checkpoint**: Created standard checkpoint for D36-D45 Sync.

## 4. Next Steps
*   **Phase**: POLISH.
*   **Target**: D46 (Kernel Risk Lanes).
