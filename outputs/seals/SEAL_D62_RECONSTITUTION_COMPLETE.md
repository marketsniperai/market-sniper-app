**Status:** [x] META-VALID (Index Referenced)

## 2. D63 Block Restored
The "System Consolidation Phase" block (Day 63+) has been successfully appended to the `OMSR_WAR_CALENDAR__35_55_DAYS.md`.
**Status:** [x] VERIFIED

## 3. OS Modules Inventory (v4.1)
The `docs/canon/OS_MODULES.md` file has been upgraded to Version 4.1 (Day 63), reflecting:
- Exact Count: 89 Modules.
- New Layer Structure (Core, Ops, Intel, Data, UI, Logic, Tooling).
- Canon Drift Report included.
**Status:** [x] OVERWRITTEN (Source: Stash 4)

## 4. Code & Visual Hardening
Critical code artifacts from the stash were manually applied:
- `market_sniper_app/lib/widgets/command_center/market_pressure_orb.dart`: Visual Polish (160px, Trinity Balance).
- `backend/os_ops/state_snapshot_engine.py`: Hardening Logic (Wrap/Unwrap).
- `market_sniper_app/lib/screens/command_center_screen.dart`: Confirmed valid (Trinity HUD present).

## Verdict
The repository state has been successfully reconciled with the Mega-Archive dump. The D62/63 gap is closed.

**NEXT STEPS:**
- Proceed to D63 execution (Snapshot Coverage Expansion).
