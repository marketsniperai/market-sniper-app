# SEAL: CANON SYNC (UP TO DAY 08)

## 1. Sync Status
*   **Canon Alignment**: **COMPLETE**
*   **Reality Match**: **VERIFIED**
*   **Drift**: **ELIMINATED**

## 2. Updated Documents
*   `ARTIFACT_CONTRACT.md` (Updated)
*   `ENDPOINT_CONTRACT.md` (Updated)
*   `SYSTEM_ATLAS.md` (Created/Populated)
*   `MAP_CORE.md` (Created/Populated)
*   `PRINCIPIO_OPERATIVO__MADRE_NODRIZA.md` (Created/Populated)
*   `PROJECT_STATE.md` (Updated)

## 3. Verification Protocol
*   **Evidence**: Derived directly from `SEAL_DAY_08_MISFIRE_MONITOR_AND_AUTOHEAL.md` and `outputs/runtime/` logs.
*   **No Fiction**: Only deployed infrastructure (`marketsniper-api`, `google-job`) is documented.
*   **No Future**: Phase 3 (Day 09+) is explicitly marked as PENDING.

## 4. Statement of Truth
"The Canonical Documentation now accurately reflects the Operating System state as of Day 08. The System is Autonomous, Self-Monitoring, and Persistence-Hardened."

## 5. Next Steps
*   Proceed to Day 09 (Frontend Integration) using the updated `ARTIFACT_CONTRACT` as reference.
