# SEAL: DAY 43 — LAYOUT POLICE (DOC + DEBUG GUARD)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This seal certifies the introduction of the Layout Police — a documentation and runtime guard system to enforce high-quality layout discipline in Founder Builds without blocking Release Builds.

## 1. Documentation
- **Canon Doc:** `docs/dev/LAYOUT_POLICE.md`
- **Rules Enforced:**
  1.  One primary scrollable per screen.
  2.  No naked Columns for dynamic content.
  3.  No fixed-height hacks.
  4.  Sheet Controller Coupling.
  5.  Slivers for complex dashboards.

## 2. Infrastructure
- **Guard:** `LayoutPoliceGuard` (lib/guards/layout_police.dart)
- **Mechanism:** Intercepts `FlutterError.onError` to detect:
  - RenderFlex overflows.
  - Unbounded height errors (ListView inside Column).
  - ParentDataWidget errors.
  - Ghost Controllers.
- **Wiring:** Installed in `main.dart` ONLY when `AppConfig.isFounderBuild` is true.

## 3. Verification
- **Non-Blocking:** Confirmed that errors are logged but execution continues (original error handler called).
- **Release Safe:** Logic is gated by `isFounderBuild`.
- **Proof:** [Layout Police Proof](file:///c:/MSR/MarketSniperRepo/outputs/proofs/day_43/day_43_layout_police_guard_proof.json)

## 4. Governance
- **Status:** SEALED
- **Type:** INFRASTRUCTURE_GUARD
- **Authorized By:** Founder (via Antigravity)
