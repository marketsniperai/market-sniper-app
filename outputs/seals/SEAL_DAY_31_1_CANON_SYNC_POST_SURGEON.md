# SEAL: DAY 31.1 - CANON SYNC ABSOLUTE (POST-SURGEON)

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** SEALED
**Author:** AGMS Archetype

## Executive Summary
This seal synchronizes the **Canonical Documentation** with the **Operational Reality** of the MarketSniper OS as of Day 31 (The Surgeon). It resolves the "Map vs Territory" drift accumulating since the Day 27 refactor.

## Objectives Met
1.  **Truth Alignment:**
    - `SYSTEM_ATLAS.md` and `OS_MODULES.md` now accurately reflect the split between **Intelligence (AGMS)** and **Operations (Ops)**.
    - `PRINCIPIO_OPERATIVO` now codifies the **Titanium Law** and **The Surgeon** laws ("Source is Sacred").
2.  **Autonomy Definition:**
    - `MAP_CORE.md` formally marks **Phase 3 (Brain)** and **Phase 4 (Self-Repair)** as COMPLETED.
    - `MODULE_COHERENCE_WIRING_LAW.md` defines the **Handoff Bridge** pattern.
3.  **Artifact Audit:**
    - `ARTIFACT_CONTRACT.md` updated to include critical runtime artifacts (`agms_handoff`, `shadow_registry`, `policy_snapshot`).
    - `ENDPOINT_CONTRACT.md` updated to include Intelligence endpoints.

## Governance State
- **System Version:** 2.1
- **Autonomy Level:** 3 (Conditional Autopilot + Runtime Self-Repair).
- **Documentation Status:** GREEN (Synced).
