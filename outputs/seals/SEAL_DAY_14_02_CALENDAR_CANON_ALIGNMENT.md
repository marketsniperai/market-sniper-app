# SEAL: DAY 14.02 - CALENDAR CANON ALIGNMENT

**Date**: 2026-01-14
**Author**: Antigravity (OMSR)
**Status**: PASS

## 1. Objective
Repair `OMSR_WAR_CALENDAR__35_45_DAYS.md` to strictly match the "seal truth" (existing artifacts) for Days D9–D14, ensuring no historical checkmark exists without a corresponding Seal artifact.

## 2. Inventory & Truth
Executed inventory of `outputs/seals/` for D9-D14. The following seals established the ground truth:

| Day | Status | Seal Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| D09 | PASS | `SEAL_DAY_09_FRONTEND_SYSTEM_HEALTH_SURFACE.md` |
| D10 | PASS | `SEAL_DAY_10_DUAL_PIPELINE_LOCKS_COOLDOWNS.md` |
| D11 | PASS | `SEAL_DAY_11_SCHEDULER_DUAL_CADENCE.md` |
| D12 | PASS | `SEAL_DAY_12_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_PACK.md` |
| D13 | PASS | `SEAL_DAY_13_DEPLOYMENT_AND_HANDOVER_PACK.md` |
| D14 | PASS | `SEAL_DAY_14_01_AUTOHEAL_ARGS_FIX_AND_REVERIFY.md` |

## 3. Changes Applied
### Content Alignment
- **D9-D12**: Updated from `[ ]` to `[x]` and added direct links to the verified seals.
- **D11**: Updated title to "Scheduler Dual Cadence".
- **D12**: Updated title to "Release Candidate Pack".
- **D13-D14**: Verified links and checkmarks (D14 pointed to the D14.01 fix seal).

### Governance Logic
- Appended **Governance Footnote (D14.02)** to the calendar, explicitly creating space for micro-steps (Dxx.xx) and defining the "Seal = Checkmark" rule.

## 4. Unsealed Days (Truth)
- D8 remains sealed (`SEAL_DAY_08_MISFIRE_MONITOR_AND_AUTOHEAL.md`).
- D15+ remain purely planned `[ ]`.

## 5. Conclusion
The OMSR War Calendar now physically reflects the artifact reality of the repository.

## 6. Next Steps
- Proceed to Day 15.
