# SEAL: DAY 45.15 — COMMAND CENTER CONTENT SPEC (FINAL)

## SUMMARY
D45.15 (Canonical Final) redefines the Command Center as a pure "Institutional Context" surface. Legal disclaimers are removed in later revisions in favor of a strictly evidence-backed structure ("OS Focus"). The content is rendered deterministically via `CommandCenterBuilder`, adhering to the "Today's Key Moves" schema with zero predictive language.

## FEATURES
- **OS Focus**: "Today's Key Moves" replaces "Context Shifts".
- **Evidence-Based**: Confidence expressed solely via badges (PULSE, OVERLAY, etc.).
- **Institutional Tone**: Micro-copy header: "Institutional context snapshot — evidence-backed."
- **Gating**:
  - **Elite**: Full Access.
  - **Plus**: Blurred + Progress.
  - **Free**: Frosted Glass ("Institutional context available inside").
