# Proof: D45.HF10G Volume Intel Timeline (Scrubber + Future Badge)

## Changes
1. **Scrubber Logic**:
   - Added `_timelineValue` (0.0..8.0).
   - Mapped 0..3 to Past (-60m..-15m).
   - Mapped 4 to NOW.
   - Mapped 5..8 to Future (+15m..+60m).
   - Logic: `_onTimelineChanged` updates `_isReplayMode` and `_replayIndex`.
2. **Future Mode**:
   - If `_timelineValue > 4`:
     - Disables Replay Mode (shows current frame).
     - Shows "Forward Context" subheader with Info icon.
     - Hides Sector List; Shows "PROBABILISTIC CONTEXT (CALIBRATING)" Badge.
3. **Modal**:
   - `_showProjectionModal` explains the feature.
4. **Ledger**:
   - Added `PEND_INTEL_PROJECTION_LANE_EVIDENCE_ARTIFACT` to `PENDING_LEDGER.md`.

## Verification
