# Ranked Recommendations

1. **Unify Premium Logic**: Refactor `EliteInteractionSheet._tier` to strictly use `PremiumStatusResolver` instead of local fallbacks.
2. **Wire Access Ledger**: Ensure `EliteAccessWindowController` writes to `os_elite_access_window_ledger.jsonl` on every check.
3. **Populate Recall Artifacts**: Ensure `os_elite_agms_recall_contract.json` is generated by AGMS, not just static.
4. **Standardize Gating**: Move "Upgrade to Elite" SnackBar logic to a shared `EliteGate` widget.
5. **Enforce Protocol**: Validate all `/elite` endpoints against `os_elite_explainer_protocol.json` schema.
6. **Time Traveller projection**: Connect `TimeTravellerChart` to real `os_projection.json` data when Elite is active.
7. **Tactical Playbook**: Unlock real data (currently blocked) when Elite.
8. **Micro Briefing**: Implement dynamic briefing generation in `elite_micro_briefing_engine.py` (currently likely stub).
9. **Explain Router**: Implement real router logic in `explain_router.py` (currently static loader).
10. **LLM Prep**: add `PEND_BRAIN_LLM_BOUNDARY` to `PENDING_LEDGER.md` (Already done in D48, but confirm).
