# Proof: D45.HF10E Layout Police Fix

## Changes
1. **Hierarchy Refactor**: `Stack` child refactored to:
   `LayoutBuilder` -> `AnimatedBuilder` -> `Stack`.
2. **Correct Nesting**: `Positioned` is now a direct child of `Stack` (previously nested inside `LayoutBuilder` inside `Stack`).

## Verification
- `flutter analyze`: Passed (Baseline).
- Rationale: `Positioned` requires `StackParentData`, which is only provided by `Stack` to its *direct* children. The refactor ensures this.
