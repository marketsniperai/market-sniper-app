# Firebase Identity Discovery (FAILED)

## Attempts
1. **Project IAM Search**: No principals matching `firebase` or `hosting`.
2. **Service Account List**: No SAs matching `firebase` or `hosting` found in `gcloud iam service-accounts list`.
3. **Identity Force Creation**:
   - Command: `gcloud beta services identity create --service=firebasehosting.googleapis.com`
   - Result: `INVALID_ARGUMENT: IAM_SERVICE_NOT_CONFIGURED_FOR_IDENTITIES`

## Conclusion
The project `marketsniper-intel-osr-9953` does not have a provisioned Firebase Hosting Service Agent.
The API `firebasehosting.googleapis.com` does not support `gcloud beta services identity create`.
Without this identity, we cannot grant `roles/run.invoker` to the hosting rewrite service.

## Blocker
A manual "Seed" of the Hosting service is likely required via the Firebase Console to spin up the hidden service agent.
The CLI approach is dead-ended.
