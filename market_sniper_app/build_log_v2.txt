Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\MSR\MarketSniperRepo\market_sniper_app\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\MSR\MarketSniperRepo\market_sniper_app\android/build.gradle) by the following line in the dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\MSR\MarketSniperRepo\market_sniper_app\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\MSR\MarketSniperRepo\market_sniper_app\android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.
