**AGENTS AND AUTOMATED SYSTEMS:**

Do **NOT** implement code or make changes without first reading and internalizing the Prime Directives located in:
> `docs/canon/ANTIGRAVITY_CONSTITUTION.md`

**VIOLATION OF PRIME DIRECTIVES:**
- Using `Colors.red` or raw `Color(0x...)` in UI widgets.
- Committing files in `outputs/runtime/` to source control.
- Modifying Core OS without updating `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Failing to Seal a Task.
